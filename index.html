	<h1> Learning about data structures </h1>
	<h2> 27-04-2017 </h2>
	
	<p> Started yet another 
	<a href="https://github.com/pixlark/DataStructures">
	repository </a> today. Since I'm self-taught, I feel
	like I'm missing out on a lot of important formal
	topics. So, I'm using this repository to write implementations
	of some basic but important data structures:
	
	<ul>

	<li> Linked Lists </li>
	<li> Queues </li>
	<li> Stacks </li>
	<li> Binary Trees </li>
	<li> Hash Tables </li>	
	
	</ul>
	
	</p>
	
	<p>

	And after that, I'll move onto algorithms, a topic that
	I know a little more about, but am still quite the novice:
		
	<ul>

	<li> Quicksort </li>
	<li> Insertion sort </li>
	<li> DFT </li>
	<li> BFT </li>
	<li> Heapsort </li>
	<li> A* </li>	
	
	</ul>	
	
	</p>

	<h1> Ludum Dare 38 </h1>
	<h2> 25-04-2017 </h2>
	
	<p> I participated in the <a href="http://ldjam.com/"> Ludum Dare</a> this year. For those
	unaware, it's a challenge where thousands of people try to
	create a fully-functional video game in 48 hours by themselves.
	You have to write your own code, draw your own art, foley your
	own sounds, and compose your own music. </p>
	<p> My game, <a href="http://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/planet-defense"> Planetary Defense</a>, is probably the best game
	that I've made. Not code-wise - the code is awful - but it's
	the most playable and enjoyable thing I've made. I used the
	framework <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a>, which is very new to me (the primary reason that
	my code is as bad as it is). </p>
	<p> As someone who previously only used full engines like Unity,
	SFML is very interesting. I've been watching the YouTube series
   <a href="https://handmadehero.org/">Handmade Hero</a>, which is what convinced me to switch over to
   a framework. It's definitely more difficult to program in, 
   but it's so freeing to have access to everything from the ground
   up. (Well, it handles the Windows API and OpenGL for me, but
   you know what I mean). </p>
   <p> As a side note, the strange description to my game is meant
   to be a parody of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yars%27_Revenge">old Atari games</a> where they would come up
   with ridiculously bad stories to try and legitimize the crappy
   graphics. </p>
