		<h1>Updated the Website</h1>
		<h2>02-06-2017</h2>

		<p>I decided to update the look of the website today. I added a navigation bar which takes you to a list of my most pertinent programming projects, a personal glossary that I'll be using to keep track of terms, a list of the music I've written, and even a little page for my stories (Abandon all hope ye who enter here!). </p>
		<p>If anyone finds a bug with the site, just leave an issue at <a href="https://github.com/pixlark/pixlark.github.io">the repository</a>. In a few days, I'm going to leave an update on what I've been learning about this past month of inactivity.</p>

	<h1> More on data structures and algorithms </h1>
	<h2> 04-05-2017 </h2>
	
	<p> After a couple days of trying to teach myself about
	data structures, I learned two things: </p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Data Structures and Algorithms are not seperate topics,
		in fact they are so intertwined that it's practically useless
		to try and learn them seperately. </li>
		<li>It's much more difficult than I anticipated to teach yourself about this topic 
		just by googling. </li>	
	</ol>
	
	<p>So, I've decided to learn about this stuff through an online course -
	specifically "Algorithms I" with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sedgewick_(computer_scientist)">Robert Sedgewick.</a> Let's see how <em>this</em> goes.</p>

	<h1> Learning about data structures </h1>
	<h2> 27-04-2017 </h2>
	
	<p> Since I'm self-taught, I often feel
	like I'm missing out on important formal
	topics. So, I've decided to try writing implementations
	of some basic but important data structures:
	</p>

	<ul>

	<li> Linked Lists </li>
	<li> Queues </li>
	<li> Stacks </li>
	<li> Binary Trees </li>
	<li> Hash Tables </li>	
	
	</ul>
	
	<p>

	And after that, I'm going to move onto algorithms:

	</p>
	
	<ul>

	<li> Quicksort </li>
	<li> Insertion sort </li>
	<li> DFT </li>
	<li> BFT </li>
	<li> Heapsort </li>
	<li> A* </li>	
	
	</ul>

	<p>Let's see how this goes...</p>

	<h1> Ludum Dare 38 </h1>
	<h2> 25-04-2017 </h2>
	
	<p> I just participated in the <a href="http://ldjam.com/"> Ludum Dare</a>, a game jam where thousands of people try to
	create a fully-functional video game in 48 hours by themselves.
	You have to write your own code, draw your own art, foley your
	own sounds, and compose your own music. </p>
	<p> My game, <a href="http://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/planet-defense"> Planetary Defense</a>, is a fun little thing where you rotate around a planet and set down towers (the theme was "Small World"). I used the
	framework <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a>, which is very new to me, thus some pretty spaghetti code.</p>
	<p> As someone who previously only used full engines like Unity,
	SFML is very interesting. I've been watching the YouTube series
   <a href="https://handmadehero.org/">Handmade Hero</a>, which is what convinced me to switch over to
   a framework. It's definitely more difficult to program in, 
   but it's so freeing to have access to so much stuff from the ground
   up. </p>
   <p> As a side note, the strange description to my game is meant
   to be a parody of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yars%27_Revenge">old Atari games</a> where they would come up
   with ridiculously bad stories to try and legitimize the awful
   graphics. </p>
