	  <h3>Badge</h3>
	</a>
	<p>
	  Badge is a functional programming language. Its syntax is drawn largely from Haskell other MLs, though the semantics are more similar to Lisp. It compiles to bytecode, which is run on a virtual machine. At the moment, it only supports a limited set of features, but what it does have is well-tested and stable. The interpreter is written in C++.

	<h4>Sample code, calculating the 10th fibonacci number:</h4>
	<pre>
	  <code>
@import[prelude].

func fib(n) {
    func iter(a, b, n)
        if   n == 0
        then a
        else this(b, a + b, n - 1).
    iter(0, 1, n)
}.

% Prints "55"
println(fib(10)). 
	  </code>

	  <h3>Manetheren</h3>
	</a>
	<p>
	  Manetheren is, at the moment, a small 3D game engine written in C++ that renders a grid-based level through the classic raycasting technique used in games like Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM, and Duke Nukem.

	  <h3>Ludum Dare 44</h3>
	</a>
	<p>
	  For the Ludum Dare 44, a biannual 48-hour game jam, I made a puzzle game about managing concurrency, titled "Your Life is Concurrency." The game is written in Go, using bindings to the SDL2 library.
