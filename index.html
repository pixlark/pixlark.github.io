		<h1>I did it.</h1>
		<h2>08-06-2017</h2>

		<p>I've been working through the book <a href="https://www.crypto101.io/">Crypto 101</a> to learn about cryptography. After getting through the section on Block Ciphers, I wanted to actually do something. So I found a block cipher algorithm, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_cipher">Hill Cipher</a>, which <i>looked</i> simple. All I had to do was learn about matrices. So I started writing a python library that dealt with them (side-note: I realize that it would have been much easier to use something like numpy, but then I don't really have an understanding of how it works). </p>
		<p>I got encryption working - now for decryption. This involves inverting the matrix - sounds simple, right? No. It's really not. It took a day to figure out how this works and to get it working in python. That's when I realized that this algorithm uses a different type of inversion called <i>Modular Inversion</i>. It's not that different, the last step just uses the modular inversion of the determinant. I just have to learn what modular inversion is. Turns out that understanding that requires learning about another entirely new area of math, modular arithmetic. Took another day to figure that out (and I still don't really understand the Extended Euclidean Algorithm).</p>
		<p>Today, on day three, I finally got it working. My program generates a random square matrix and streams your plaintext through, splitting it into vectors and multiplying them against the key matrix. The ciphertext is then decoded by performing a modular matrix inversion on the key and streaming the ciphertext through it in the same way as before.</p>
		<p>It's really not as impressive as it sounds, but whenever I finally conquer something difficult, I love to talk about it in an incredibly obscure way to boost my ego. Anyway, this is what I've been doing recently. I suppose I should move on to the next chapter in Crypto 101 now.</p>

		<h1>Updated the Website</h1>
		<h2>02-06-2017</h2>

		<p>I decided to update the look of the website today. I added a navigation bar which takes you to a list of my most pertinent programming projects, a personal glossary that I'll be using to keep track of terms, a list of the music I've written, and even a little page for my stories (Abandon all hope ye who enter here!). </p>
		<p>If anyone finds a bug with the site, just leave an issue at <a href="https://github.com/pixlark/pixlark.github.io">the repository</a>. In a few days, I'm going to leave an update on what I've been learning about this past month of inactivity.</p>

	<h1> More on data structures and algorithms </h1>
	<h2> 04-05-2017 </h2>
	
	<p> After a couple days of trying to teach myself about
	data structures, I learned two things: </p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Data Structures and Algorithms are not seperate topics,
		in fact they are so intertwined that it's practically useless
		to try and learn them seperately. </li>
		<li>It's much more difficult than I anticipated to teach yourself about this topic 
		just by googling. </li>	
	</ol>
	
	<p>So, I've decided to learn about this stuff through an online course -
	specifically "Algorithms I" with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sedgewick_(computer_scientist)">Robert Sedgewick.</a> Let's see how <em>this</em> goes.</p>

	<h1> Learning about data structures </h1>
	<h2> 27-04-2017 </h2>
	
	<p> Since I'm self-taught, I often feel
	like I'm missing out on important formal
	topics. So, I've decided to try writing implementations
	of some basic but important data structures:
	</p>

	<ul>

	<li> Linked Lists </li>
	<li> Queues </li>
	<li> Stacks </li>
	<li> Binary Trees </li>
	<li> Hash Tables </li>	
	
	</ul>
	
	<p>

	And after that, I'm going to move onto algorithms:

	</p>
	
	<ul>

	<li> Quicksort </li>
	<li> Insertion sort </li>
	<li> DFT </li>
	<li> BFT </li>
	<li> Heapsort </li>
	<li> A* </li>	
	
	</ul>

	<p>Let's see how this goes...</p>

	<h1> Ludum Dare 38 </h1>
	<h2> 25-04-2017 </h2>
	
	<p> I just participated in the <a href="http://ldjam.com/"> Ludum Dare</a>, a game jam where thousands of people try to
	create a fully-functional video game in 48 hours by themselves.
	You have to write your own code, draw your own art, foley your
	own sounds, and compose your own music. </p>
	<p> My game, <a href="http://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/planet-defense"> Planetary Defense</a>, is a fun little thing where you rotate around a planet and set down towers (the theme was "Small World"). I used the
	framework <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a>, which is very new to me, thus some pretty spaghetti code.</p>
	<p> As someone who previously only used full engines like Unity,
	SFML is very interesting. I've been watching the YouTube series
   <a href="https://handmadehero.org/">Handmade Hero</a>, which is what convinced me to switch over to
   a framework. It's definitely more difficult to program in, 
   but it's so freeing to have access to so much stuff from the ground
   up. </p>
   <p> As a side note, the strange description to my game is meant
   to be a parody of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yars%27_Revenge">old Atari games</a> where they would come up
   with ridiculously bad stories to try and legitimize the awful
   graphics. </p>
