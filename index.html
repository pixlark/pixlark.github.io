    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I graduated in 2022 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Binghamton University. I now work at Tesla, probably on cool top secret stuff. If I told you, I'd have to kill you. In my free time I'm super into programming language development and music, both of which you'll find dominate this personal-project-website.

      <h3>C Major</h3>
    </a>
    <p>
      A sane language on a similar abstraction level to C, that compiles to C and can (almost) seamlessly interact with C libraries, a-la Zig or Nim, but with a more functional lean. Written in Haskell. Remarkably unfinished.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
# Only some of this code would currently compile.
# However, this is the general direction of the language.          
@entry(main)

func fibonacci(n: int) -> int
do {
  var iter := func(a: int, b: int, n: int) -> int
              do if n == 0
                 then a
                 else iter(b, a, n - 1);
  iter(0, 1, n)
}

func main() -> nothing
do {
  print fibonacci(10);
}
      </code>
    </pre>
	<a href="https://pixlark.github.io/Badge">
	  <h3>Badge</h3>
	</a>
	<p>
      Badge is a dynamically typed, interpreted functional programming language written in C++. It compiles to bytecode which is run on a virtual machine. At the moment, it only supports a limited set of features, but what it does have is well-tested and very stable.
	</p>
	<h4>Sample code, calculating the 10th fibonacci number:</h4>
	<pre>
	  <code>
@import[prelude].

func fib(n) {
  func iter(a, b, n)
    if n == 0
    then a
    else this(b, a + b, n - 1).
  iter(0, 1, n)
}.

% Prints "55"
println(fib(10)).

	  <h3>Manetheren</h3>
	</a>
	<p>
	  Manetheren is, at the moment, a small 3D renderer written in C+. It draws a first person view of the level using old, classic raycasting techniques from games like Wolfenstein 3D and DOOM.

	  <h3>Ludum Dare 44</h3>
	</a>
	<p>
	  For the Ludum Dare 44, a biannual 48-hour game jam, I made a puzzle game about managing concurrency, titled "Your Life is Concurrency." The game is written in Go, using bindings to the SDL2 library.

	<p>
	  Scrift is an album I recorded during the 2020 quarantine.

    <h3>Assorted covers</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes I record covers of songs I like, for fun. Here's a couple.

	<h3>Assorted originals</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes I also write little one-off songs that aren't part of any album. Here's a couple of those.
