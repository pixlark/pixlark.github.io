<p>Before I get into my new project, a little update on Edict
		- it's a mess right now. I'm probably going to revisit it at
		some point, but right now the codebase is just an absolute
		pigsty. I'm satisfied, however. I got a lot of cool
		functionality in, and I learned a <i>lot</i> about working on
		large-scale projects. In fact, I think the things I learned
		have been a lot of help so far and will continue to be in
		my new project.</p>
<p>My and my <a href="https://ben-humphries.github.io/">friend</a>
		have been talking for the longest time about making a video
		game together. I recently read the book Masters of Doom about
		John Carmack and John Romero, and it inspired me to suggest a
		project - a game from scratch. I would learn OpenGL and try
		to build a basic engine, and we would build a game on top of
		it - with a tentative division of roles, where I am more
		low-level and he is more high-level.</p>
<p>So far, <a href="https://github.com/pixlark/gleng">the
		engine I have built</a> can do very little besides render
		simple textures - but it renders them. And I'm quickly working
		on expanding it. Hopefully in the ensuing weeks I can bring
		him in on the project and we can make a game together. I'm
		very excited.</p>
<p>In other news, I am about to start applying for colleges
		since I got my SAT scores back from College Board -
		1440. Everyone is assuring me that it's a good score but I'm
		honestly quite disappointed because my practice test scores
		went all the way up to 1530 - and I took eight practice
		tests. Unfortunately, on most of my practice tests I did the
		math section only because I assumed it would be what I
		struggle with most. As it turns out, the reading/writing
		sections were more difficult than anticipated. Thanks to that,
		my reading/writing section brought the score down
		considerably. I'm still happy with it, though. I put a lot of
		work into studying for the math portion and I think it paid
		off.</p>
<p>I've decided to take up SUNY's offer to pay for my college
		tuition in exchange for remaining in New York for four years,
		so I'll only be applying to SUNY schools really. It will be
		interesting to spend the first four years of my career in NYC
		- as I assume that's my best option for getting a good job out
		of college. I'm getting ahead of myself, though. I should
		probably be working on my applications right now.</p>
<p>Finally, work on the new album is steadily increasing. I
		have a few really good songs that I'm excited to release on
		it, and they all share a similar aesthetic which is more than
		I could say for ALLITERATION. The tentative name for the new
		album is <i>don't worry</i>, but again - tentative.</p>
<span class="small-text">Album I can't stop listening
		to: <i>Houses of the Holy</i> by Led Zeppelin<br/> Standout
		songs: <i>Dancing Days, The Rain Song, Over the Hills and Far
		Away</i> and <i>No Quarter</i> (yes that's half the album,
		it's just that good)</span>
