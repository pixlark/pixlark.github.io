  <h1>Winter</h1>
  <h2>18-12-2018</h2>
  <p>I've always felt that, while I have a lot of projects under my belt, they all fall into one of two categories: small, finished projects and large, unfinished projects. So when winter break began five days ago, I began work on a large project that I plan to have completed by the end of break (five or six weeks).</p>
  <p>This project is the continuation of my work in a field that I have found myself endlessly fascinated in over the past year---the creation of programming languages. I've made a few small and essentially pointless interpreted languages and a couple completely broken and unfinished compiled languages (compiling to machine code is really hard!), but my effort with this project, temporally named <b>Winter</b>, is to create a fully-fledged interpreted language that can do pretty much anything you would expect of a scripting language of it's ilk (think like Python).</p>
  <p>The language has come along very far since I began, mostly because it's literally the only thing I've been doing day-in and day-out. We're at around two thousand lines of code at the moment (all in C of course), which isn't a very good metric usually but might give you an idea for the extent to which I've been busting on this thing so far. We have operators, functions (first-class!), multiple types including strings, if-elseif-else statements, loops, some <i>really</i> fancy error messages that I'm very proud of (picture below) and a fancy little python script that runs automated tests to make sure I don't break anything when changing the interpreter.</p>

  <p>I'm really excited about how Winter is turning out so far. At some point I'll need to stop adding features and just say "this is it, this is the language," because otherwise this will just be another large, unfinished project wasting away on my github. But for now, I'm having a really fun time!</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Some example code:</b></p>
  <div class="code-block"><pre>
func fibonacci(n) {
	a = 0;
	b = 1;
	
	i = 0;
	loop {
		i = i + 1;
		if i > n {
			break;
		}
		
		print a;
		
		temp = b;
		b = a + b;
		a = temp;
	}
}

fibonacci(10);
</pre></div>
