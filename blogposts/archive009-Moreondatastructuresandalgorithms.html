<h1>More on data structures and algorithms</h1>
<h2>04-05-2017</h2>
<p>After a couple days of trying to teach myself about data
        structures, I learned two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data Structures and Algorithms are not seperate
          topics, in fact they are so intertwined that it's
          practically useless to try and learn them
          seperately.</li>
<li>It's much more difficult than I anticipated to teach
          yourself about this topic just by googling.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I've decided to learn about this stuff through an
        online course - specifically "Algorithms I" with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sedgewick_(computer_scientist)">
        Robert Sedgewick.</a> Let's see how <em>this</em> goes.</p>
<p class="small-text">Album I can't stop listening to:
        <i>Hardwired... to Self-Destruct</i> by Metallica<br/>
        Standout songs: <i>Hardwired, Atlas Rise!,</i> and <i>Spit
        out the Bone</i></p>
