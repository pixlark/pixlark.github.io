<h1>Blog Overhaul</h1>
<h2>06-10-2018</h2>
<p>Wow, it's been a while. I've done a lot of stuff. Got admitted to SUNY Binghamton, been here for a couple months. Finished a lot of projects, abandoned many more. Decided to finally come back and update the site. Specifically, these posts are now dynamically loaded using JS, which makes creation of new posts drastically easier. That's how I'm writing this one, actually. I did the same to the projects section, and updated it afterwards because it was woefully out-of-date. Hopefully now I can update this blog more often.

And as for music I can't stop listening to? Too much to count since ten months ago. Here are some highlights: <i>Superunknown</i> by Soundgarden, <i>Overkill</i> by Colin Hay, <i>The Seed (2.0)</i> by the Roots, <i>What a Time to Be Alive</i> by Superchunk, <i>I Bet on Sky</i> by Dinosaur Jr., <i>Alien Lanes</i> by Guided by Voices, and <i>Art Angels</i> by Grimes... just off the top of my head.
