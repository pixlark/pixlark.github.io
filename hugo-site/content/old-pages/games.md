# Manetheren
### June 2020

[Manetheren](https://github.com/pixlark/Manetheren) is, at the moment, a small 3D renderer written in C++. It draws a first person view of the level using old, classic raycasting techniques from games like Wolfenstein 3D and DOOM. I decided to make this project after reading the excellent book "Masters of Doom", which among other things first exposed me to the genius of John Carmack.

# 2048 Clone
### November 2018

I made [this](https://github.com/pixlark/rust-2048) little 2048 clone a long time ago as a way to learn the Rust programming language. It was successful -- I still love using Rust to this day!

# Ludum Dare Entries
### 2016-Present

Since 2016 I've been regularly participating in the [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/), a competition where the goal is to make a game entirely from scratch in 48 hours. These are some gifs and images of games I've made over the years. [Here](https://ldjam.com/users/pixlark) is my profile on the LD website if you'd like to peruse, however note that games from before 2017 are gone as there was a website change that year.

These games, above all else, are often fantastic ways to learn new things. Often I will enter a Ludum Dare with the simple goal of using a new language, or a new game engine that I hadn't before. Usually the games themselves don't turn out great -- but the fun is in the learning.

For example, this year I made [a very rudimentary idle game](https://github.com/pixlark/LD51) as a way to learn [Lua](https://lua.org/) and the barebones [LOVE2D](https://love2d.org/) game engine.

Likely my most successful game was [this puzzle game](https://github.com/pixlark/LD44) from 2019, which I made as a way to learn the [Go](https://go.dev/) programming language.

Lastly, I beg of you not to peruse these codebases too carefully! Rushing to make a game in 48 hours does not result in good code. For that, I would refer you to any of the other games on the list.
