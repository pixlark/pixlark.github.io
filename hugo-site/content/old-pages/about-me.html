<p>Hello! I'm Brooke (full name: Brooke Scott Tilley). I'm 22 years old, I use she/her pronouns üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è, and I'm a recent graduate of <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/">Binghamton University</a> (go Bearcats!).</p>

<p>I'm deeply passionate about computer programming, and have been from the age of eight when my dad introduced me to C# (I told him I wanted to learn how to make videogames).</p>

<p>Outside of school, I've worked at Tesla as a software engineer, both as an intern and as a full-time employee. You can read more about that experience <a href="/tesla">here</a>.</p>

<p>I spent many of my early years making games, and you can read about some of those projects <a href="/games">here</a>. I still enjoy working on games sometimes, but I've found another programming interest that has largely superceded it.</p>

Just before starting college, I became extremely interested in the design and implementation of programming languages. Since then, I've made several programming languages (in varied states of success), all of which you can read about <a href="/programming-languages">here</a>. This passion has also led me to exploring many different existing programming languages, and even finding an unusual favorite language: <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>.

  func iter(a, b, n)
    if n == 0
    then a
    else this(b, a + b, n - 1).
  iter(0, 1, n)
}.

% Prints "55"
println(fib(10)).

<p>I have played the guitar from a similarly young age (around eight). I also play the piano and sing, and I write my own music, including releasing a couple of albums. If you're interested in any of that, you can hear some of my music <a href="/music">here</a>.</p>

<p>To briefly mention other interests -- I like to write short stories and poetry. I enjoy playing videogames, especially single-player RPGs. I also enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons with friends, and even ran my own campaign for a couple of years.</p>

<p>That's about it! If you'd like to know anything else, feel free to shoot me an email at <em>brooke.tilley.2k[at]gmail.com</em></p>
