In the summer of 2021, I joined Tesla as a software engineering intern. I worked alongside my mentor and two other interns, fixing bugs and adding new features to a large Haskell project. I can't go into detail about that project, but I learned a lot in those few months. Haskell was already my favourite language going in, so being able to work with people who were *so* incredibly smart and experienced with it was amazing.

Near the end of that internship, I also completed an independent project -- a simulator written in C, which dynamically loaded binaries and tested them against certain requirements.

After graduating from Binghamton, I took a full-time position at Tesla. This time, however, I was moved to an entirely different role doing embedded microprocessor programming. I learned a lot about this new field, but ultimately decided to leave the company in September of 2022.
