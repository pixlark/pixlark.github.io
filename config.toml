My name is Brooke, I'm a software developer from New York. I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science from [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu/).

&nbsp;  

Before leaving in September 2022, I was a full-time employee at Tesla, doing embedded work alongside higher-level Haskell programming. I also interned there over the summer of 2021.

&nbsp;  

Some of my primary interests are: programming language design and implementation, game development, music performance and composition, and creative writing.
