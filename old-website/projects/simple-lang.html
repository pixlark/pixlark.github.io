	A dirt-simple programming language. Wanted to write a compiler, but didn't want to figure out x86 or LLVM IR or any of that. So I wrote a really simple VM that does as little as possible, and wrote a "compiler" targeting it. By the time I stopped working on this project, it wasn't because it had reached a finished state, it had just turned into a hot mess. It barely works. But the principle are there, and I learned a <i>lot</i> by creating it.
