<p class="medium-text">This was my second attempt at making
        a live sorting visualization program. It was more
        successful than my first attempt, which had the unfortunate
        problem where the program would not respond until it
        finished the visualization. I certainly solved that problem
        with this version, but my solution was far too complicated
        and made it too difficult to implement any non-naive
        algorithms. So all the algorithms you can use in this
        version are the O(n^2) ones like Bubble, Insertion,
        etc.</p>
<p class="medium-text">I plan to eventually redo this
        project for a third time and find a way to keep the
        implementation simple while also keeping the program from
        locking up.</p>
