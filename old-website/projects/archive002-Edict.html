        Repository</a></h2>
<h3>Started October 2017; Put on hold November 2017</h3>
<p class="medium-text"><i>Update: </i>This was by far the
		biggest project I have undertaken, and I made a lot of mistakes.
		To salvage this, I'm going to have to put in a lot of work. So
		for the moment, the project is on hold.</p>
<p class="medium-text">A Text Editor that I am writing for
        personal use. I've been a devout Emacs user for a while,
        but I have SO many issues with it, mostly related to how
        bloated it is. So, I decided to write my own. It's not
        fully-featured enough yet for actual use, but it's
        completely functional. The rendering is done in SDL for
        simplicity.</p>
