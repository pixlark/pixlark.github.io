	This a completely usable interpreted programming language that I implemented over the first three weeks of my winter break. It has functions, records (structs), lists, dictionaries, lexical scoping, closures, the whole shebang. The entire pipeline of the language is written in C, from the handrolled lexer/parser to the virtual machine that interprets the compiled bytecode. All dynamically allocated objects in the language (strings, lists, functions, etc) are garbage collected using a reference-counted garbage collector.

  <i>Some arbitrary code to give you an idea of what the language looks like:</i>
</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre>
record Point {
    x, y
}

func get_origin() {
    return Point(0, 0);
}

func add_points(a, b) {
    return Point(a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y);
}

x = add_points;
print(x(get_origin(), Point(1, 1)));
</pre></div>
<br/>
<div class="code-block"><pre>
> (x, y) : {x -> 1, y -> 1}
</div>
