<h1>Ludum Dare 38</h1>
<h2>25-04-2017</h2>
<p>I just participated in the <a href="http://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare</a>, a game jam where
        thousands of people try to create a fully-functional video
        game in 48 hours by themselves. You have to write your own
        code, draw your own art, foley your own sounds, and compose
        your own music.</p>
<p>My game, <a href="http://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/planet-defense">Planetary
        Defense</a>, is a fun little thing where you rotate around
        a planet and set down towers (the theme was "Small World").
        I used the framework <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a>, which is very new to
        me, thus some pretty spaghetti code.</p>
<p>As someone who previously only used full engines like
        Unity, SFML is very interesting. I've been watching the
        YouTube series <a href="https://handmadehero.org/">Handmade
        Hero</a>, which is what convinced me to switch over to a
        framework. It's definitely more difficult to program in,
        but it's so freeing to have access to so much stuff from
        the ground up.</p>
<p>As a side note, the strange description to my game is
        meant to be a parody of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yars%27_Revenge">old Atari
        games</a> where they would come up with ridiculously bad
        stories to try and legitimize the awful
        graphics.</p><span class="small-text">Album I can't stop
