  <p>So I got pretty far with the last programming language, <a href="https://github.com/pixlark/winter-lang">Winter</a>, but eventually it got to be a bit of a mess. It's in a moderately functional state right now, but there are some unfortunate bugs with garbage collection that I don't have the patience to fix.</p>
  <p>Over the last month or so, I've been working on a new langauge that I'm a lot more excited about. While it was really fun to finally make a real, working, moderately-sized language with Winter, it wasn't exactly my dream language. It was designed essentially just for ease-of-implementation. With my new language, <a href="https://github.com/pixlark/Badge">Badge</a>, I've actually put a lot of thought into the semantics of the langauge, and I think it puts together some really interesting ideas (all stolen from other languages, of course) in a cool way.</p>
  <p>Here's one of the central ideas of the language: expressions are semantically "above" statements, not the other way around. In a language like C, the program is a series of <em>statements</em>, and expressions are just little pieces of those statements. In Badge (this is inspired by Scheme and Rust), expressions are the foremost object, and statements are all couched within expressions.</p>
  <p>What does this mean when you're programming? It means that if you want to use a statement, like the <em>let</em> statement, you have to put it within a <em>scope</em> expression:</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><div class="code-block"><pre>
{
  let x = 12.
  println(x).
}.</pre></div></p>
  <p>The curly brackets denote a scope expression, and the period-terminated lines within are <em>statements.</em> Statements always have to be terminated with a period. If you write an expression and terminate with a period, it will take that expression as a statement and throw away the value it produces. However, if you <em>don't</em> period-terminate the expression, that returns from the surround scope expression, the whole thing evaluating to whatever you ended with. Here's an example:</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><div class="code-block"><pre>
println({
  let x = 12.
  set x = x + 2.
  x - 6
}).</pre></div></p>
  <p>This will print out 12 + 2 - 6, or 8.</p>
  <p>The only place statements exist outside of scopes is at the very top-level of your program, which consists of a series of statements.</p>
  <p>A traditionally statementful place that expressions take over in Badge are if-statements, or really if-expressions:</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><div class="code-block"><pre>
println(if 1 then 2 else 3).</pre></div></p>
  <p>This will print 2, because any value other than the unitary <em>nothing</em> value is treated as a true value. Of course, if you need to something stateful in an if-expression, you can just open a scope:</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><div class="code-block"><pre>
let x = 12.
if nothing then {
  set x = x + 1.
} else {
  set x = 0.
}.
println(x).</pre></div></p>
  <p>This will print out 0.</p>
