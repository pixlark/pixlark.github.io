<h1>Updated the Website</h1>
<h2>02-06-2017</h2>
<p>I decided to update the look of the website today. I
        added a navigation bar which takes you to a list of my most
        pertinent programming projects, a personal glossary that
        I'll be using to keep track of terms, a list of the music
        I've written, and even a little page for my stories
        (Abandon all hope ye who enter here!).</p>
<p>If anyone finds a bug with the site, just leave an issue
        at <a href="https://github.com/pixlark/pixlark.github.io">the
        repository</a>. In a few days, I'm going to leave an update
        on what I've been learning about this past month of
        inactivity.</p><span class="small-text">Album I can't stop
