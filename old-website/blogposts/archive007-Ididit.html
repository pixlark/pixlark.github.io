<h1>I did it.</h1>
<h2>08-06-2017</h2>
<p>I've been working through the book <a href="https://www.crypto101.io/">Crypto 101</a> to learn about
        cryptography. After getting through the section on Block
        Ciphers, I wanted to actually do something. So I found a
        block cipher algorithm, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_cipher">Hill
        Cipher</a>, which <i>looked</i> simple. All I had to do was
        learn about matrices. So I started writing a python library
        that dealt with them (side-note: I realize that it would
        have been much easier to use something like numpy, but then
        I don't really have an understanding of how it works).</p>
<p>I got encryption working - now for decryption. This
        involves inverting the matrix - sounds simple, right? No.
        It's really not. It took a day to figure out how this works
        and to get it working in python. That's when I realized
        that this algorithm uses a different type of inversion
        called <i>Modular Inversion</i>. It's not that different,
        the last step just uses the modular inversion of the
        determinant. I just have to learn what modular inversion
        is. Turns out that understanding that requires learning
        about another entirely new area of math, modular
        arithmetic. Took another day to figure that out (and I
        still don't really understand the Extended Euclidean
        Algorithm).</p>
<p>Today, on day three, I finally got it working. My
        program generates a random square matrix and streams your
        plaintext through, splitting it into vectors and
        multiplying them against the key matrix. The ciphertext is
        then decoded by performing a modular matrix inversion on
        the key and streaming the ciphertext through it in the same
        way as before.</p>
<p>It's really not as impressive as it sounds, but whenever
        I finally conquer something difficult, I love to talk about
        it in an incredibly obscure way to boost my ego. Anyway,
        this is what I've been doing recently. I suppose I should
        move on to the next chapter in Crypto 101 now.</p>
