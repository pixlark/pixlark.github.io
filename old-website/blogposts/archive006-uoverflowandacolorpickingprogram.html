<h1>u8 overflow and a color picking program.</h1>
<h2>23-06-2017</h2>
<p>My and my friend <a href="https://ben-humphries.github.io">Ben</a> have been working
        on small projects together for the past week or so. One of
        us will screenshare to the other and we work together for a
        couple hours. After that, whoever is coding usually takes
        over and finishes it out on their own time. Most recently,
        I was the coder, and our project was <a href="https://github.com/pixlark/ColorPicker">a color picking
        program,</a> where you have an adjustable gradient that you
        can click on which gives you an RGB code.</p>
<p>Well, at one point we have an incredibly strange bug.
        The method draw_gradient() was getting stuck in an infinite
        loop, and we couldn't figure why. Our first thought was
        that it was hitting some sort of undefined behaviour in the
        SDL library, so we commented out everything besides the
        nested for loops. Still happened, except for when we never
        called draw_gradient(). So it had to be something with the
        for loops... but what? It's a <i>for loop</i>, the only way
        for it to be infinite is if the condition is never-</p>
<p>"It's overflowing!" we cried out at the same time. Since
        each RGB value was an unsigned 8 bit integer, when we
        looped over it to draw the gradient, it would never
        actually reach the condition, simply increment over 255 and
        overflow into 0. So in order to keep using u8s rather than
        u16s (because we really needed that efficiency for a
        color-picking program), the for-loops were changed to
        do-while loops.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is a bit of a lesson on premature
        optimization. And on the topic of the color picker - I'm
        planning to keep working on it myself and add an HSV mode.
        Look forward to it. And if you want to take a glance at
        another project we started together that Ben is now
        upkeeping, check out <a href="https://github.com/ben-humphries/Conways-Game-Of-Life">Conway's
