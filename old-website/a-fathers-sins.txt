a pact in sweat beneath the sand
worms crawling on the hull
the coven waits for it's next damned
Kurd beating at his skull

rodent organs slowly canned
in the factory's hidden breast

men who seek a warrant soul
fall always at the crest

worried hatchlings scurry past
the master's mighty hands
buried hatchets work to grasp
the daughter's ghastly lambs

a father's sins are visited
upon his many sons --
that's six downstairs
then one with me
and two still on the run
