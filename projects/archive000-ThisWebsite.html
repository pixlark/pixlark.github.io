<h3>Started April 2017</h3>
<p class="medium-text">This website is one of two projects that
        I maintain to practice my front-end development skills. The
        other is <a href="https://github.com/pixlark/NewTabPage">this</a>, a custom
        New Tab page that I rewrite every few months so I have a
        quick link to anywhere I want to go. I haven't learned as
        much as I'm hoping for on the back-end side of things, but
        I've been tinkering with a Raspberry Pi, and I'm hoping to
        learn a lot on that front as well.</p>
