<p class="medium-text">For the <a href="http://www.ldjam.com">Ludum Dare 38</a> game jam, I
      	created the game <i>Planetary Defense</i> in 48 hours. In
	      this game, following the announced theme of "Small World",
	      you move around a planet as red aliens careen towards you.
	      You have to frantically place and replace your limited
	      supply of towers to fend off the alien threat.</p>

<p class="medium-text">Planetary Defense is written in C++
	      using the game framework SFML. I had a lot of fun writing
	      it, and a lot of challenge as well. There was a good amount
	      of trig involved in getting things to rotate with the
	      planet, as well as in having the enemies move towards the
	      planet. It was also difficult because this was within my
	      first week of using SFML, so the framework was still very
	      unfamiliar to me. Unfortunately, this resulted in
	      completely spaghetti code. I learned a lot from the
	      experience, though, which is all that matters.</p>
