<h1>Edict</h1>
<h2>21-10-2017</h2>
<p>I've always been a fan of Emacs, but it has a lot of
        problems. Mostly these problems come from the fact that it
        it 40 years old. It's got too much baggage. So I started on
        a project that I've wanted to do for a while. I'm writing
        my own text editor called <i>Edict</i>. Just today I
        finished v0.1. It has very basic functionality - moving
        around the cursor, entering text into the buffer, removing
        text, saving, and loading. It's not anywhere near
        fully-featured enough to actually be usable, but it's on
        it's way. Hopefully I will have it at a fully-usable
        version 1.0 in the next few months.</p>
<p>Over in the PROJECTS section, you can see a nice gif of
        it working.</p><span class="small-text">Album I can't stop
