<h1>Update on the Game</h1>
<h2>19-12-2017</h2>
<p>Last post I talked about the engine I'm witing in OpenGL
		which was going to be used for a game. I got fairly far into
		writing the Engine before deciding to move back to regular SDL
		for the time being. It was a very fun excursion, but it's
		honestly pretty unneccesary complexity for the kind of games I
		make. But the game itself is going very well. It's a puzzle
		game based on the rolling of boulders on a sheet of ice (or is
		it snow? I'm not sure yet). Here's a GIF of the game in action:</p>
