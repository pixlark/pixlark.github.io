		  <h1>LD38</h1>

		  <h2><a href="https://github.com/pixlark/LD38">Git Repository</a></h2>

		  For the <a href="http://www.ldjam.com">Ludum Dare 38</a> game jam, I created the game <i>Planetary Defense</i> in 48 hours. In this game, following the announced theme of "Small World", you move around a planet as red aliens careen towards you. You have to frantically place and replace your limited supply of towers to fend off the alien threat.

		  <br/>
		  Planetary Defense is written in C++ using the game framework SFML. I had a lot of fun writing it, and a lot of challenge as well. There was a good amount of trig involved in getting things to rotate with the planet, as well as in having the enemies move towards the planet. It was also difficult because this was within my first week of using SFML, so the framework was still very unfamiliar to me. Unfortunately, this resulted in completely spaghetti code. I learned a lot from the experience, though, which is all that matters.

		  <h1>This Website!</h1>

		  <h2><a href="https://github.com/pixlark/pixlark.github.io">Git Repository</a></h2>

		  This website is one of two projects that I maintain to practice my front-end development skills. The other is <a href="https://github.com/pixlark/NewTabPage">this</a>, a custom New Tab page that I rewrite every few months so I have a quick link to anywhere I want to go. I haven't learned as much as I'm hoping for on the back-end side of things, but I've been tinkering with a Raspberry Pi, and I'm hoping to learn a lot on that front as well.

		  <h1>pixlib</h1>

		  <h2><a href="https://github.com/pixlark/pixlib">Git Repository</a></h2>

		  pixlib is my personal C/C++ standard library. Eventually, it will encompass I/O, Data Structures, Searching/Sorting, etc, but all written by me from scratch. This offers two advantages: one, it's written in a way that I understand (because I wrote it), and two, it's written in a way that I prefer. For example, I really dislike stringstreams in the C++ standard library, so I may try and code a replacement that has the same advantages but done in my way (this is the advantage of using a language with low-level access - I can literally create a new one from the ground up with unix write() calls and the like).
			<br/> <br/>
			Another example is the Vector class, which A: Has a terrible name (vectors are a math thing guys, not a list!) and B: I don't know exactly how it works. My replacement, DynArr, has a better name and was written by me, so I know exactly when and how it resizes. If I need to add more functionality to it, I go and do it myself. It's probably a bit slower, but it's not hidden from my view. If I find that it's slowing something down, then I can go and figure out how to optimize it.
			<br/> <br/>
			And of course, most importantly - it's <i>fun</i>. And it's a good learning experience.

		  <h1>Unix Command Rewrite</h1>

		  <h2><a href="https://github.com/pixlark/UnixCommandRewrite">Git Repository</a></h2>

		  UCR is a project that I work on to practice my low-level skills. Each time I go back to it, I find a new Unix command to try and rewrite in C. So far I've completed:

		  <ul>

			<li>cat</li>
			<li>grep</li>
			<li>ls</li>
			<li>more</li>
