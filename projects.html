        <h3>Started April 2017</h3>

        <p class="medium-text">This website is one of two projects that
        I maintain to practice my front-end development skills. The
        other is <a href=
        "https://github.com/pixlark/NewTabPage">this</a>, a custom
        New Tab page that I rewrite every few months so I have a
        quick link to anywhere I want to go. I haven't learned as
        much as I'm hoping for on the back-end side of things, but
        I've been tinkering with a Raspberry Pi, and I'm hoping to
        learn a lot on that front as well.</p>

        <h3>Started October 2017; Put on hold November 2017</h3>

		<p class="medium-text"><i>Update: </i>This was by far the
		biggest project I have undertaken, and I made a lot of mistakes.
		To salvage this, I'm going to have to put in a lot of work. So
		for the moment, the project is on hold.</p>  
		
        <p class="medium-text">A Text Editor that I am writing for
        personal use. I've been a devout Emacs user for a while,
        but I have SO many issues with it, mostly related to how
        bloated it is. So, I decided to write my own. It's not
        fully-featured enough yet for actual use, but it's
        completely functional. The rendering is done in SDL for
        simplicity.</p>

        <p class="medium-text">UCR is a project that I work on to
        practice my low-level skills. Each time I go back to it, I
        find a new Unix command to try and rewrite a simplified
        version of in C. So far I've completed:</p>

        <img src="sorting-demonstration.gif" alt="An insertion sort being visualized." />

        <p class="medium-text">This was my second attempt at making
        a live sorting visualization program. It was more
        successful than my first attempt, which had the unfortunate
        problem where the program would not respond until it
        finished the visualization. I certainly solved that problem
        with this version, but my solution was far too complicated
        and made it too difficult to implement any non-naive
        algorithms. So all the algorithms you can use in this
        version are the O(n^2) ones like Bubble, Insertion,
        etc.</p>

        <p class="medium-text">I plan to eventually redo this
        project for a third time and find a way to keep the
        implementation simple while also keeping the program from
        locking up.</p>

				<h3>August 2017</h3>
		
				<p class="medium-text">This was a bit of a strange project. My goal here was not actually to 
				make a clone of the game Agario - that was just a conveniently simple game to emulate on a basic level.
				My real goal was to create a framework of sort in SDL that I could reuse in later games. This means creating
				generic solutions for things like shape-drawing, resource packing, screen/world space conversion,
				 texture storage in hash tables, etc. I
				even wrote a little build system in python which has proven very useful. </p>

      	<h3>April 2017</h3>

      	<p class="medium-text">For the <a href=
      	"http://www.ldjam.com">Ludum Dare 38</a> game jam, I
      	created the game <i>Planetary Defense</i> in 48 hours. In
	      this game, following the announced theme of "Small World",
	      you move around a planet as red aliens careen towards you.
	      You have to frantically place and replace your limited
	      supply of towers to fend off the alien threat.</p>

	      <p><img src="http://static.jam.vg/raw/345/1/z/e79.png" alt="The game in action" class="post-img" /></p>

	      <p class="medium-text">Planetary Defense is written in C++
	      using the game framework SFML. I had a lot of fun writing
	      it, and a lot of challenge as well. There was a good amount
	      of trig involved in getting things to rotate with the
	      planet, as well as in having the enemies move towards the
	      planet. It was also difficult because this was within my
	      first week of using SFML, so the framework was still very
	      unfamiliar to me. Unfortunately, this resulted in
	      completely spaghetti code. I learned a lot from the
	      experience, though, which is all that matters.</p>
