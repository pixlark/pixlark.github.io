	  In November of 2016, I participated in <a href="https://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>, an event where thousands of people try to write an entire novel in one month. Due to having recently finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time">The Wheel of Time</a> series (which was fantastic, by the way), my planned novel was of the "epic fantasy" genre. Note that at this point, I've finished perhaps two or three short stories.

	<br/><br/>
	  
	  After two weeks of writing, I gave up. The story was chock-full of ridiculous plot points, flat characters, unclear motivations (not in a good way), and hundreds upon hundreds of Strunk&amp;White violations. If you're dead-set on reading it, here's a compiled PDF of the story's corpse:
