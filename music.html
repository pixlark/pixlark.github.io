		  <h1>pocketwatch.mp4</h1>

		  <h2>01-04-2017</h2>

		  Written because I wanted to do something experimental with the sample that Madvillain used in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpaonSDPw7Y">Accordian</a>.<br/>

		  <h1>Fold</h1>

		  <h2>26-02-2017</h2>

		  Definitely the biggest song I've completed. Took about twothree weeks from prototype to finished product. I learned a lot making this song, so much so that by the end I could hear mistakes I had made when I started, but that it would have taken a big gutting to fix. Heavily influenced by the Toxic Avenger song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CGMk_roNaE">Make This Right</a>. <br/>

		  <h1>BOSTON27</h1>

		  <h2>06-02-2017</h2>

		  I wanted to try something combining synthesized sounds with natural sounds. Unfortunately, I didn't have a French Horn laying around, so both were synthesized. The effect still comes across though.<br/>

		  <h1>Jargel</h1>

		  <h2>07-12-2016</h2>

		  Experiment with polyrhythmic time signatures (5/4 and 4/4 concurrently) and with a "Hey Jude"-style coda repeating at the end.<br/>

		  <h1>The Enemy Marches</h1>

		  <h2>04-07-2016</h2>

		  A piano/cello duet. My attempt at a song using more classical instrumentation.
